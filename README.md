# Yolo-DinoV2
Yolo-DinoV2 integrates Meta's DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer model, as a frozen feature extractor backbone into Ultralytics' YOLO object detection framework. This combination aims to enhance few-shot object detection capabilities, allowing for effective training with minimal data.

## Features

- **‚≠ê DINOv2 Backbone**: Utilizes DINOv2's robust feature extraction to improve object detection performance. All DinoV2 backbone sizes supported (uses registers)

- **‚≠ê Seamless Integration**: Maintains compatibility with Ultralytics' YOLO, enabling standard training and inference workflows.

- **‚≠ê Few-Shot Learning**: Designed to generalize well with relatively small datasets, facilitating quick training on custom data.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itsprakhar/Yolo-DinoV2.git
   cd Yolo-DinoV2
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **‚öôÔ∏è Model Initialization**:

   Use the configuration files in the `yolo_dinov2_configs` directory to initialize the YOLO model with the DINOv2 backbone. Modify the `nc` parameter in the YAML file to match the number of classes in your dataset.

2. **üèãÔ∏è Training**:

   Train the model as you would with any YOLO model from Ultralytics. Refer to Ultralytics' [training documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/#train) for detailed instructions.

3. **üèÉInference**:

   Same  you would with any YOLO model from Ultralytics. Refer to Ultralytics' [Inference documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/#predict) for detailed instructions.


- **ü•π Pretrained Weights**: Pretrained weights are not available. However, the model can be trained quickly on custom data with relatively small datasets üòä, thanks to its strong generalization capabilities.
